"""Tier-2 piecewise CUDA-graph steering (vllm::steer_apply).

The engine boots WITHOUT enforce_eager so the model is torch.compiled
and piecewise cudagraphs are captured. Covers: config wiring (the
steer_apply splitting op and piecewise cudagraph mode), steering firing
under compiled execution, scale-0 steering being byte-identical to no
steering, and byte-identical replay of a repeated steered run.

Compiled kernels drift numerically from eager, so there is no
byte-compare against an eager golden (the original script printed that
diff as informational only); the checks here are behavior-level within
one compiled engine.
