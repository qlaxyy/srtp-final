    steering ops to the compilation splitting ops so the compiled
    graph is partitioned at every steered layer and steering runs
    eagerly between the segments — all algorithms supported, at
    roughly half the throughput of in-graph steering. "auto" (default)
    resolves from the declared workload during VllmConfig post-init:
    "in_graph" when compiled execution is on and every declared
