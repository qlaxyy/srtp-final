"""The single base class every steering algorithm extends.

An algorithm is a pure transformation over selected token rows: it
provides `_transform` (the core math) plus optional `load_from_path`
(engine-loaded file formats). Where a vector applies lives in
`self.clause` (see clause.py), fully decoupled from the math.

Full-graph (Tier-1) support is declared on the class: `graph_family`
names a kernel family in graph_kernels.GRAPH_FAMILIES (None =
split-tier only, rejected at admission under graph_mode=in_graph), and
`graph_lower` maps this algorithm's (payload, scale) onto that family's
slot tensors — colocated with the eager `_transform` whose math it must
reproduce.
