"""Tier-1 full-graph steering kernels and their buffer schema.

The kernels here are pure tensor math over persistent buffers, safe to
capture into CUDA graphs / compiled code. Rows and masks are filled
host-side before each step; row 0 of every table is zero, so unsteered
or padding tokens and idle families contribute exact zero deltas.

GRAPH_FAMILIES is the closed schema the kernels are written against —
adding a family means extending both the schema and the kernel in the
same change. Algorithms opt in by declaring `graph_family` +
`graph_lower` on their class (see algorithms/base.py).
