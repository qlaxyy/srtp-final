"""Hook-based capture of intermediate model state.

One CaptureSession per worker owns named capture *streams*:

- ``hidden_states``: complete post-layer hidden states (hidden + residual)
  from every decoder layer, discovered structurally with the same
  class-name-list fallback as steering (architecture-agnostic).
- ``router_logits``: MoE router logits, captured by a forward hook on
  each MoE block's gate/router submodule (works for any architecture
  whose experts run on vLLM's fused-MoE stack — no per-model class list
  required; the list is only a hint). When router-logits steering is
  active, the captured logits are the post-steering ones.

Hooks never mutate the model tree (no wrappers, no module renames) and
are inert until a stream is enabled. They work on any engine: hook
bodies trace to nothing under torch.compile (compiled artifacts and
CUDA graphs carry no capture code), and while a stream is enabled the
runner dispatches batches to the raw eager forward (skip_compiled),
where the hooks run natively; idle batches keep full performance.
Prefix caching needs no engine-level restriction either — capture
requests carry a unique cache_salt (full recompute, no cache hits), and
unsalted requests that do hit the cache are flagged at admission and
fail explicitly at fetch. Each stream is configured at enable
time with a layer subset, storage dtype, a row-selection clause
(`select`, the shared SelectSpec where-clause language also used by
steering), a per-sample reduction (`reduce`: "all" | "last" | "mean")
and a row budget, bounding capture memory — selection and reductions
turn an O(tokens) capture into O(matches)/O(samples), which covers the
common probing/diffmean workflows.

Storage (vllm.capture.store) appends one CPU chunk per forward step and
concatenates at fetch time; there is no batch-boundary heuristic. Every
stored row is labelled with (request id, absolute position, token id)
so clients never re-derive sample alignment. Row selection and
labelling live in vllm.capture.selection.

Relation to upstream: vLLM's ``extract_hidden_states`` speculative
method (with a hidden-states KV connector) also extracts per-layer
hidden states, computed identically (hidden + residual, see
``SupportsEagle3._maybe_add_hidden_state``) — so values from the two
mechanisms are directly comparable. Prefer that path for bulk offline
extraction over a fixed layer set; this session is for interactive use:
runtime enable/disable, arbitrary layer subsets with no graph change,
reductions/budgets, and router logits (which upstream does not capture).
