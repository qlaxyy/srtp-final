# Steering (v2 API)

Steering is configured with three objects from `vllm.steer_vectors`
(see [`STEERING_API_V2.md`](https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/EasySteer/blob/main/docs/design/STEERING_API_V2.md)
for the design rationale):

1. **`ApplySpec`** — *where and when* a vector applies (phases, token/position filters,
   generation window).
2. **`VectorSpec`** — one vector: source file, algorithm, scale, layers, normalize,
   algorithm-specific `params`, and its `apply` clause.
3. **`SteeringSpec`** — an ordered list of `VectorSpec`s plus a conflict policy.

Specs are backend-independent: eager, `split`, and `in_graph` engines accept the same
spec; a request using an algorithm outside the engine's declared `steer_algorithms`
is rejected at admission (the declaration is required whenever steering is enabled —
see the [vllm-steer steering guide](../../vllm-steer/docs/features/steer_vectors.md)).

## Attaching a spec

Same object, two scopes:

- **Per request**: `llm.generate(prompts, steering=spec, ...)`, or the JSON field
  `"steering"` on HTTP requests (see [OpenAI-compatible server](openai-server.md)).
- **Engine default**: `--steering-config spec.json` (or inline JSON) at startup,
  replaceable at runtime via `POST /v1/steering {"spec": {...}}` (resets the prefix
  cache).

Server-level and per-request steering cannot currently be combined in one request.

## `ApplySpec`: the where-clause

`ApplySpec` shares its selection language with hidden-state capture (both subclass
`SelectSpec`), so a clause means the same thing in both systems.

Each phase is selected independently and only by what you name: there is no
separate phase gate. `prompt="all"` selects every prompt token and
`generation="all"` every decode step — the widest include selector of each
phase — and six narrower include selectors, three per phase, each named for
it and carrying a symmetric exclude twin, refine the selection. A phase with
neither `"all"` nor a selector is untouched:

| Include | Exclude twin | Matches |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt_tokens` | `exclude_prompt_tokens` | Token-id allowlist (real ids, `>= 0`) over prompt occurrences. |
| `prompt_positions` | `exclude_prompt_positions` | Prompt positions; negative values are Python-style from the end of the prompt (`-1` = last prompt token), stable across prefill chunks. Positive values past the prompt end clamp to the last prompt token (warned at admission). |
| `prompt_window` | `exclude_prompt_window` | Half-open `(start, stop)` over prompt positions; negative bounds and `stop=None` resolve from the prompt end (`(-5, None)` = the last five prompt tokens). |
| `generation_tokens` | `exclude_generation_tokens` | Token-id allowlist over generated occurrences. |
| `generation_positions` | `exclude_generation_positions` | Exact 0-based decode steps (`[0]` = the first generated token). |
| `generation_window` | `exclude_generation_window` | Half-open `(start, stop)` over 0-based decode steps; `stop=None` = unbounded. `(0, k)` selects exactly the first `k` decode steps. |

The include selectors (with `prompt="all"` / `generation="all"` among them)
select the **union** of their matches. The exclude selectors union and
**always subtract**: where an include and an exclude overlap, the exclusion
wins; an exclude requires its phase to be covered, and a clause that selects
nothing is rejected — as is the removed `phases` key. One clause can mix
granularities across phases:

```python
# Last prompt token plus the whole generation (the SHARP shape):
ApplySpec(prompt_positions=[-1], generation="all")

# Prompt tail plus the first decode steps:
ApplySpec(prompt_window=(-4, None), generation_window=(0, 4))
```

## `VectorSpec`: one vector

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `source` | `None` | Path to a vector file in a format EasySteer itself defines (its GGUF export; the `moe_router` JSON). For third-party checkpoint formats use `data` instead. Plain path only — no `"path\|algo"`. |
| `data` | `None` | An in-memory payload (see [Steering with your own tensors](#steering-with-your-own-tensors)). Mutually exclusive with `source`. |
| `algorithm` | `"direct"` | Registry key: `direct`, `linear`, `loreft`, `lm_steer`, `erase`, `replace`, `concept_replace`, `moe_router`. |
| `scale` | `1.0` | Scale factor (negative suppresses the direction). |
| `layers` | `None` | Layer indices to apply to; `None` lets the file decide. |
| `normalize` | `False` | Normalize the vector before applying. |
| `apply` | — | **Required** `ApplySpec`. |
| `params` | `{}` | Algorithm-specific parameters, validated per algorithm; unknown keys are rejected. Only `moe_router` takes params: `expert_ids`, `mode`, `lambda`, `topk`. |
| `name` | `None` | Label used in logs only (not identity). |

## Steering with your own tensors

The engine loads only formats whose schema EasySteer defines. Everything else —
pyreft checkpoints, LM-Steer `.pt` files, pickled transport maps, or tensors you
just computed — is passed in memory through `VectorSpec(data=...)` using the
canonical payload structures:

| Payload | Algorithms | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `DirectionVector({layer: vec})` | `direct`, `erase`, `replace` | one 1-D vector per layer |
| `LinearMap(weight, bias=None)` | `linear` | one affine map, applied to each `layers` entry |
| `LowRankProjector(p1, p2)` | `lm_steer` | low-rank update factors, applied to each `layers` entry |
| `ReftIntervention(rotate, weight, bias=None, layer=None)` | `loreft` | LoReFT intervention; `layer` from the checkpoint wins |
| `ConceptPair(h1=..., h2=...)` | `concept_replace` | named roles — steer toward `h1`, away from `h2` |

```python
from vllm.steer_vectors import ApplySpec, DirectionVector, SteeringSpec, VectorSpec

# Any tensor you have — numpy or torch — becomes steerable directly:
spec = SteeringSpec(vectors=[VectorSpec(
    data=DirectionVector({10: my_vector}),
    scale=2.0,
    apply=ApplySpec(prompt="all", generation="all"),
)])
```

Payloads are validated at construction (shapes, finiteness, role names) and
identified engine-side by a content hash, so identical payloads share one
resident copy regardless of how many requests carry them. `easysteer.vectors`
ships adapters for the common third-party layouts (`from_pyreft`,
`from_lm_steer`, `from_linear_transport`, `from_pt_direction`, `from_gguf`),
and `easysteer.vectors.from_control_vector(cv)` steers an extraction result
with no GGUF round-trip.

## `SteeringSpec`: vectors + conflict policy

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `vectors` | — | Non-empty ordered list of `VectorSpec`s. |
| `conflict` | `"priority"` | When several vectors target one position: `"priority"` (first wins), `"sequential"` (stack in order), `"error"`. |
| `debug` | `False` | Verbose logging during the forward pass. |

`moe_router` is not yet supported in multi-vector specs.

## Examples

```python
from vllm.steer_vectors import ApplySpec, SteeringSpec, VectorSpec

# Single vector on every prompt + generated token
sentiment = SteeringSpec(vectors=[
    VectorSpec(source="vectors/happy.gguf", scale=2.0, layers=[10, 11, 12],
               apply=ApplySpec(prompt="all", generation="all")),
])

# Several directions stacked at the second-to-last prompt token
multi = SteeringSpec(
    conflict="sequential",
    vectors=[
        VectorSpec(source="dir1.gguf", scale=1.5, layers=[20],
                   apply=ApplySpec(prompt_positions=[-2])),
        VectorSpec(source="dir2.gguf", scale=-0.8, layers=[20],
                   apply=ApplySpec(prompt_positions=[-2])),
    ],
)

# Steer only the first 8 generated tokens
early = SteeringSpec(vectors=[
    VectorSpec(source="vectors/happy.gguf", scale=2.0, layers=[10, 11, 12],
               apply=ApplySpec(generation_window=(0, 8))),
])
```

## Interaction with engine features

- **Prefix caching** is supported: block hashes are keyed by the steering config
  fingerprint; engine-default mode salts every hash, and spec updates reset the cache.
- **Chunked prefill** is supported; negative positions resolve stably across chunks.
- **CUDA graphs**: full-graph mode currently requires a single-vector, `direct`,
  non-normalized spec; other specs are rejected at admission with an explicit error.
  `--steer-graph-mode` is an engine optimization setting and never changes how a spec is
  written.

## Migrating from v1

The v1 surface (trigger fields, `steer_vector_request`, `--steer-vector-path` flags, the
`-1` token sentinel, `"path|algo"` sources) has been **deleted**. Key semantic changes:

- Exclusions always subtract; nothing bypasses them.
- `generation_window=(0, k)` steers exactly `k` decode steps (the v1 `first_k`
  off-by-one is gone).
- Phase selection (`phases`) replaces the `-1` sentinel.
- `normalize` defaults to `False` everywhere, including server-level steering.
- `generation_window` is an include selector like any other: it **unions** with
  the token/position selectors instead of constraining decode tokens, and a
  cross-phase clause with only a `generation_window` no longer covers the
  prompt — select prompt tokens explicitly (e.g. `prompt_window=(0, None)`).
- Every selector is phase-scoped and named for it: token-id filters split into
  `prompt_tokens` / `generation_tokens`, and `prompt_positions` (formerly
  `positions`) selects prompt tokens only — decode steps are always addressed
  through `generation_positions` / `generation_window`.
